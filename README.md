## My process
My process behind this challenge was to start by figuring out how to control each box on its own without doing too much to make the challenge complicated. I choose to use flexbox and put the three main box inside of a container to and work on each box seperate from the other. In the end I group some of the elemts together to use less CSS code instead of having all the CSS seperate for each box.

### Built with

- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
